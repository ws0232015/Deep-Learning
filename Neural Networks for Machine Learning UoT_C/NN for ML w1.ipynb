    "#### What is ML?<br>\n",
    "1. hard to write programs that can recongnizing 3-D object from a novel viewpoint in new lighting condistions in a cluttered scene.<br>\n",
    "    (1). Don't know neither how to write this program nor how brain work with this problem.<br>\n",
    "    (2). Program maybe horrendously complicated.<br>\n",
    "2. hard to write program to compute the probability that a credit card fraudulent transaction.<br>\n",
    "    (1). no simple or reliable rule and need combine large # of weak rules.<br>\n",
    "    (2). Program need keep changing to follow the fraud.<br>\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### The mML Approach<br>\n",
    "1. Instead write program for each task, collecting lots of examples that specift the correct output for given input.<br>\n",
    "2. ML algorithm takes the problem and produces program that does the job<br>\n",
    "    (1). Program produced by ML may different from hand-written program. Containning millions of #s.<br>\n",
    "    (2). If right, program works for both new cases and the training one.<br>\n",
    "    (3). Data change, program change, training on new data.<br>\n",
    "3. Massive amounts of computation now cheaper than write task-specific program.<br> "
