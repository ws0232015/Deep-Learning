    "Similar to ordinary Neural Networks. They are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a loss function (SVM/Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer. ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images.<br>\n",
